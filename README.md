# Cultivate
Cultivate is a wellness tracker that enables users to create custom habits, influences, and symptoms, track them, and analyze how they correlate with each other over time. Users can authenticate GCal to quickly scrape habits from events in their calendar, and they can automatically track the weather as an influence (via OpenWeatherMap). Cultivate uses D3 and Chart.js to provide interactive charts that visualize the user's data and illustrate which events correlate.

Bonus: Users can access a "Yoga Class Picker" that scrapes data from 15 different yoga studios, generating a list of classes the user can take based on their availability, location, and travel time (via Google Maps).
